# EE474_Project
18SP at University of Washington
This is totally new LAB of Professor Peckol's EE474.
It is relatively challenging comparing with other EE474 of UWEE(or UWECE later).
The lab report is useless and way too long. 
But the lab is fantastic. You can write a true large Application using a Real-Time OS Kernel to support it and can remote it within LAN!
